## **9V Solenoid Driver**

Based on [Xwhatit's work](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=58192), modified to work natively through QMK's haptic feedback/solenoid implementation and to be easily implementable for custom keyboard designers.  
All credits for the circuitry goes to Xwhatsit (source viewable [here](https://github.com/BASLQC/xwhatits-capsense-controller)).
